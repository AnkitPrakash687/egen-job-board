As the team in unison proclaims: “We aren't that hip”. It’s expected that you'll pitch in with ideas to develop and improve the product and codebase.</p>\n<p>Flipbooks is the original product, the spine of the company. One of the tasks at hand is converting the last bits of the original JavaScript to TypeScript and upgrading the codebase as you deprecate features and browsers.</p>\n<p>You will have a chance to influence the product moving forward and you can take responsibility of projects that you think are exciting and worth exploring if it’ll benefit the product. It’s a position where you will be able to develop and improve your skills.</p>\n<p><strong>Great benefits, a friendly team and professional development</strong></p>\n<p>The package includes a competitive salary based on your experience and qualifications. The HQ is a very nice and modern office in the heart of Aarhus (parking is possible). At the office, you will be met with a lunch scheme, soda, tea, coffee and snacks and you will be invited to join your colleagues for a drink on Fridays.</p>\n<p>You will join a diverse company of 30 people spread across 10 nationalities. The development team counts 8 people. The company culture is built on giving trust and responsibility to employees, so you won’t spend time on tracking tasks - you won't be registering hours and you’re free to work at your own pace.</p>\n<p><strong>Who are you?</strong></p>\n<p>Your main experience lies with TypeScript or JavaScript, preferably from working on large projects. In addition, you also have worked with HTML &amp; CSS and you have experience with source control - merging, branching, pull requests. You like to participate in code reviews - everything is reviewed and a lot of bugs are caught doing it.</p>\n<p>As a person, you want to influence product development and you want to keep improving your skills to become even better at doing what you do best: coding.</p>\n<p><strong>About the recruitment process</strong></p>\n<p>Kold+Partners are handling the recruiting process.

Backed up European venture capital, the company has grown into a competitive player in the cloud hosting industry, with clients ranging from the small developer to major web agencies and blue-chip enterprises running significant infrastructure deployments or fleets of hundreds of sites. Our technology stack -- the one we’d like to hire you to help build -- makes this experience as seamless and full-featured as possible for every client.</p>\n<p>We are expanding the engineering team that builds this tool into a self-service product across that entire range of clients. This means software components that do everything from furnish the end-user experience in the web browser or on the command line, to backend components that drive other portions of the product.</p>\n<p>You should be a proficient software engineer with at least one of the following languages:\nGo\nPHP\nJavaScript\nPython\nYou should also be proficient in the domain of web application development, with domain knowledge that broadly addresses at least some of the following areas:</p>\n<p>Git-based workflows and software projects across multiple repositories and codebases\nUser authentication and authorization flows between online web applications\nE-commerce workflows, recurring billing operations, reporting, etc.\nMulti-service or cross-application interaction and design\nImplementation of web applications according to open standards (i.e. RFCs et al.)\nJob Description\nWe do lots of everything here: from client libraries and the command-line interaction layer, to web applications that drive the end-user interface for the product, billing &amp; reporting, user authentication &amp; authorization, interaction with vendors or partners, and the occasional piece of staff tooling that interacts with that software.</p>\n<p>With that in mind, we’re looking for engineers to help us build any and all of these pieces! We have serious web applications written in Go, PHP, Python, and JavaScript, all of which are critical to some part of our interaction layer for users. Taken together, they form a key piece of our cloud hosting and devops tooling product -- if you’re especially interested in the devops and cloud solutions space, then we’re especially interested in you. Being comfortable tackling programming problems from the architecture level all the way down to proper code implementation is also important to us -- though we are growing fast, the team is still small, the to-do list long, and engineers generally have a great deal of autonomy to implement features and drive the product forward.  Your contribution matters.</p>\n<p>You should be a proficient software engineer with at least one of these languages and be experienced with the domain of web application development. We’ve listed other qualifications or experience that make for great candidates; many of these relate only to a subset of the listed languages and they are provided as examples rather than any sort of exhaustive list.</p>\n<p>It would be great if you:</p>\n<p>Have broad familiarity with the cloud hosting and “DevOps” domain and knowledge of the experience and requirements of e.g. our customer base\nKnow how to evaluate open web standards and use those to guide API decisions &amp; application implementation\nHave experience making multiple web applications “play nicely” together and function together as an integrated product\nHave experience with user authentication &amp; authorization flows as well as the other security &amp; compliance requirements endemic to software accessible over the Internet\nHave experience working with custom Drupal code\nUnderstand or are familiar with the domain of recurring payments, e-commerce, etc.\nHave experience with the React framework\nAre familiar with front-end data visualization, libraries like D3.js, etc.\nHave worked on front-end accessibility development, e.g. WCAG requirements or related standards</p>\n<p>About Us\nPlatform.sh is a global, distributed company, with over 200 staff members located in 33 countries throughout the world. Although our home base is in Paris, France, somewhere between 90 and 100% of our work happens outside the confines of the office -- every position is entirely remote/work-from-home, something we now have over a decade of experience in making work well.</p>\n<p>Typical work communication happens either via text chat media (i.e. Slack) or on voice/video calls for synchronous planning or sprint sessions. In keeping with our remote-first orientation, we generally take a flexible approach towards working hours and meeting the needs of staff who have children, are managing the schedules of multiple family members at home, and so on. All of this has made Platform.sh a great place to work, and we are proud of an extraordinary retention rate throughout the company’s entire history.</p>\n<p>The product we make is an advanced tool for cloud hosting and software engineering &amp; development of web applications. Our goal is to be able to take the codebase of a working application -- the customer’s web site code -- and turn it into a running copy of that codebase with the appropriate infrastructure in a matter of minutes. This means that our product is responsible for the entire lifecycle of the customer’s application -- from being able to quickly spin up new environments for development, CI, and testing, to running a stable production codebase that matches exactly what the developers were testing with.</p>\n",

      "description": "<p>Come join the world’s largest shared CI/CD platform in our Growth teams, and play a key role in driving the future success of our company! Together with teammates across our company, you will discover what drives organizations to adopt and become successful using CI/CD, and improve our product to help make developer teams across the world more effective. You’ll collaborate closely with your team and many other teams across engineering, design, product, revenue, marketing, and more. In this cross-functional role, use data to learn and make decisions, and evolve this space together. Together with your team, you’ll design and run experiments, and drive the maturing of our Growth engineering practices, as well as grow your own engineering skills as this space evolves.</p>\n<p><strong>Our team:</strong>\nAs the Growth team, our mission is to expose more users to the value they can get through using our product, and getting deeper into CI/CD with us. We dig deep into our users’ experience with CircleCI, and help them become more successful using our product. Focusing on our users’ onboarding experience through their first weeks with us we hypothesize, build, study outcomes, and iterate together. We work hand in hand with our Product, Data, Design, Marketing, and Engineering teammates. Every day we work to improve our product in order to support our go-to-market teams and drive sustainable long-term growth for our entire company.</p>\n<p>Our position in the engineering team is unique: we work throughout the entire CircleCI product – across marketing sites, onboarding, all the way to our core CI/CD workflows – to help empower our users to deliver better software faster. As we’re maturing our Growth engineering practices and build out and implement our technical strategy, we will increasingly work across the stack, and will shift from a stronger frontend-focus to working more on the backend as well. As a team that’s curious to constantly learn and evolve, we’re growing together every day.</p>\n<p><strong>What you’ll do:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Learn! You’ll learn something new about our product and our users every single day: through user feedback, data, and your work with your teammates. You’ll develop a deep understanding of how people use our product, what makes them successful, and how we can evolve our product to engage more organizations. You’ll learn how to drive revenue through engineering measures, how to get more customers to use our products and increase their engagement with us – key lessons for anyone interested in starting their own business one day. You’ll also learn more as an engineer, and move from a stronger frontend-focus to working more across the stack, and collaborate with your teammates to build out your technical skills.</li>\n<li>Have business impact: You will conceive and execute experiments with the goal of learning more about how our users use our product, working with people across our entire company, always looking to increase your impact on our business.</li>\n<li>Run experiments and iterate quickly: Hypothesize, plan, architect, implement, run, and review experiments to rapidly iterate on features.</li>\n<li>Work with a collaborative, fast-moving team: Collaborate and mentor your engineering teammates through planning, pairing, testing, and delivery of the features you build.</li>\n<li>Take ownership of your work: As part of this role, you’ll participate in our team’s on-call rotation in the event that production issues occur.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>What we’re looking for:</strong>\nWe’re looking for someone who has a learning mindset, is curious and highly motivated to learn something new everyday. If you are also interested in having business impact, and bring strong communication skills, this might be for you! Here are more details on what we’re looking for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A curious mind: You are motivated by your curiosity and deep desire to learn something new every day. You enjoy tackling different types of projects, and rolling up your sleeves to dig deep into our users’ experience with our product. You value knowledge and adapting based on data, and have attention to detail.</li>\n<li>Desire to creatively learn: You’re excited about the prospect of learning how to become a great product-minded engineer, where you will get to implement your product ideas and influence our product direction and roadmap. Your satisfaction as an engineer comes from what you learned, not what you built, and you’re comfortable throwing out most of the code you write. In order to support a learning culture, you strive for continuous learning and improvement for yourself and your team.</li>\n<li>Strong communication and collaboration skills: You enjoy working closely with your teammates, brainstorming and developing ideas together. You have strong feedback skills and communicate openly with your team and are open to being wrong and having your mind changed.</li>\n<li>Desire to impact the future of our business: You like working on high exposure projects and tasks, and are keen to have impact in a crucial business domain.\nInterest in moving fast: You’re experienced in the day-to-day practices of continuous delivery and agile development in a production environment. You favor regular, incremental delivery over perfection.</li>\n<li>Technical skills: You have at least four years of experience writing, deploying, and iterating quickly on front-end code (we use React, GraphQL), and you will also get to grow your backend development skills (we use Clojure, but it’s fine if you haven’t yet). We estimate that you will spend around 70% of your time in the frontend, but as you grow into the role we expect it to become more balanced between work on the frontend and backend. You consider technology a tool for solving users’ problems, and are interested in learning new technology when required. You can find our entire tech stack here.</li>\n<li>Adaptability: You’re comfortable with ambiguity and figuring things out as they evolve, change, and new requirements emerge. You’re good at managing the ambiguity of a small, rapidly-growing company: adjusting to changing priorities, making conscious tradeoffs when guidance is limited and information is incomplete, and instituting best practices from scratch when needed.\n<strong>Bonus points:</strong>\nExperience as an entrepreneur, a growing startup, or working in Growth Engineering teams is a plus.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Work remotely with our globally distributed team!</strong>\nWe’re a distributed company with teammates across the world. Our Growth teams are distributed across North America. For this role, we are hiring engineers to work remotely in the United States and through our affiliate, Continuous Labs, in the following Canadian provinces: Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba, New Brunswick, Newfoundland and Labrador, Nova Scotia, Ontario, Prince Edward Island and Saskatchewan.</p>\n<p>We know there’s no such thing as a “perfect” candidate - we’re all a work in progress and are growing new skills and capabilities all the time. CircleCI welcomes those who are enthusiastic about learning and evolving, so however you identify and whatever your background, if this looks like a role where you could do work that excites you, we hope you’ll apply.</p>\n<p><strong>About CircleCI</strong>\nCircleCI is the world’s largest shared continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) platform, and the central hub where code moves from idea to delivery. As one of the most-used DevOps tools that processes more than 1 million builds a day, CircleCI has unique access to data on how engineering teams work, and how their code runs. Companies like Spotify, Coinbase, Stitch Fix, and BuzzFeed use us to improve engineering team productivity, release better products, and get to market faster.</p>\n<p>CircleCI is proud to be an Equal Opportunity and Affirmative Action employer.

Organizations around the world are navigating extreme disruption and upheaval. Sudden and sweeping shifts to remote work, emerging hybrid working models, and the adoption of new ways of working are having profound impacts on teams.</p>\n<p>SHIFT’s clients include some of the world’s most respected Fortune 500s, like Roche, ExxonMobil and Vanguard, and tech giants like Netflix and Airbnb. We’re on a mission to keep serving their teams and to expand to any team who needs us. We’ve been featured in the Harvard Business Review, at global tech conferences and on countless leadership podcasts, as we seek to democratize the art of winning and healthy teams.</p>\n<p><strong>The Role</strong></p>\n<p><strong>We are searching for a talented and experienced Full Stack Engineer to join our Engineering team, located in the timezone UTC +8 or UTC -3 hours.</strong></p>\n<p>The Engineering team at SHIFT is a fully remote team from the ground up.

You will become part of our team, taking on the variety of tasks that makes full stack engineering enjoyable—and keeps our software dev engine humming. You will have a big impact on SHIFT’s success by enabling us to provide white-glove service to our clients, who are generally large Fortune 500 companies.</p>\n<p><strong>You</strong></p>\n<p>We're looking for a remote (UTC+8/UTC-3) Engineer who can hit the ground running in a fast paced nature of a growing startup, as a member of a collaborative engineering team. As a Full Stack Engineer you will turn user stories into software solutions, able to deliver vertical slices that cover frontend, API, backend, and DB.You should be a critical and creative thinker, and have excellent communication and problem-solving skills.</p>\n<p>You should have an ownership mindset and be a self-starter, always striving to deliver the highest-quality solution for our clients, while having the ability to see how to balance quality vs the pragmatic reality of quickly putting delivered features into users’ hands.</p>\n<p>Lastly, it is important that you are excited about working with a remote Engineering team. The Business team is located in North America, primarily Toronto, but the Engineering team is worldwide and plans to stay that way.</p>\n<p>We are primarily looking for remote candidates in the UTC +8 or UTC -3 timezones, for example, UTC + 8: Australia, Brunei, China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Macau, Malaysia, Mongolia, Philippines, Russia, Taiwan, UTC - 3: Argentina, Bermuda, Brazil, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, Chile, Falkland Islands, French Guiana, Uruguay - among other relevant locations.</p>\n<p><strong>As a Full Stack Engineer you can expect to:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Actively communicate in our written forums like work tickets, slack, and github PR comments</li>\n<li>Actively participate in our regular team video calls to get the most out of a limited medium</li>\n<li>Perform code reviews, and respond to having your code reviewed</li>\n<li>Develop new front-end product features in TypeScript using React, with a focus on creating a seamless user experience with our tools</li>\n<li>Develop the backend REST API in Laravel framework PHPInteract with the DB via Laravel’s ORM (Eloquent) in code, as well as via SQL when investigating issues</li>\n<li>Occasionally (rarely), interact with legacy server-rendered Laravel blade pages and frontend - snippets rendered by MithrilJS in coffeescript</li>\n<li>Write automated tests for your work to support confident future code changes</li>\n<li>Work on high value, rapid development projects that allow SHIFT to evaluate new hypotheses and prototype new ideas</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>We’re looking for you to have the following qualifications:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>A minimum of 3 - 5 years experience in a full stack engineering role, but if you’re more senior that’s great too</li>\n<li>You are ideally located in UTC+ 8 hours or UTC -3 hours to work collaboratively with our current remote team</li>\n<li>We are also open to someone with front-end experience who is smart and eager to hone their back-end skills</li>\n<li>Experience building web applications, preferably within an enterprise context</li>\n<li>You write understandable, testable code with an eye towards understandability and maintainability</li>\n<li>You are a strong communicator - explaining complex technical concepts to designers, support, and other engineers is no problem for you</li>\n<li>A creative thinker with strong problem-solving abilitiesIt would be great if you had experience at a startup and/or with a remote engineering team (but it’s not necessary)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>What you’ll get from SHIFT</strong></p>\n<p>In addition to competitive compensation, equity, health benefits and an annual learning grant, we offer our team the opportunity to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Learn from a seasoned entrepreneurial leadership team</li>\n<li>Solve relevant, complex and uncharted business problems</li>\n<li>Opportunity to own projects and strategic priorities in a high learning environment - regardless of seniority</li>\n<li>Build relationships across sectors, functions and time zones in a supportive and people-first environment</li>\n<li>Contribute to the evolution of teams by helping to refine our digital tools and products</li>\n</ul>\n<p>SHIFT is an equal-opportunity employer and we value diversity at our company. For Toronto-based roles, we are not able to offer relocation at this time.</p>\n<p><strong>Our Values</strong></p>\n<p>At SHIFT, we embrace and actively cultivate the following values:</p>\n<p>-Own it: We believe that anyone can be an owner and everyone at SHIFT must be an owner. A SHIFT owner is someone who: is willing to set a hard goal that they don’t necessarily know how to meet, will work to achieve that outcome despite inevitable obstacles, will solve the underlying problem vs. ticking a box to complete a task, asks for feedback and thought partnership, and communicates key learnings and their process throughout.</p>\n<p>-Debate to great: We want the best ideas, ambitious goals and decisions. Almost no idea or goal is the best in its original form. We believe collective problem solving, debate and conflict sharpens ideas, ambitions and decisions into better versions, and can help everyone improve.\nShip fast, learn fast: We seek the shortest path to get to better outcomes. This means that we operate with pace and a focus on learning quickly so that we optimize our learning, in service of getting to the right answer in the least amount of time.</p>\n<p>-Push our potential: We want everyone to be at the edge of their personal learning zone and we believe that most people have more learning capabilities than they know. We will find the opportunities, projects, roles and external resources needed to allow people to continually grow and learn.</p>\n<p>-Teamwork is our foundation: We practice what we preach and have a deep understanding and appreciation for how important strong team foundations like psychological safety, mutual trust and strong communication are. We work hard to provide the space and opportunities needed to foster strong team foundations and we’ll also dogfood our own products regularly to keep us aligned.</p>\n",
